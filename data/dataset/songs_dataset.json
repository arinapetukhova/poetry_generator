Who better for you than the boy, huh?\n\nI love me\nI love me enough for the both of us\nThat's why you trust me\nI know you been through more than most of us\nSo what are you\nWhat are you, what are you so afraid of?\nDarling, you\nYou give, but you cannot take love\n\nUh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures\nOr further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage\nWhen I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit\nA weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it\n'Cause that night I played her three songs\nThen we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on\nThen she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz\nBoy, was she wrong\nThat was just negative energy for me to feed off\nNow it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria\nOr Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria\nLandmarks of the muses that inspired the music\nWhen I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it\nThe one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree\nI've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me\nNow she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?\nKnow we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't\nRemember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz\nGirl, I felt like we had it all planned out\nI guess I fucked up the vision\nLearning the true consequences of my selfish decisions\nWhen you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven\nIt seem like you don't want this love anymore\nI'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore\nBut girl, what qualities was I looking for before?\nWho you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?\n\nI love me\nI love me enough for the both of us\nThat's why you trust me\nI know you been through more than most of us\nSo what are you\nWhat are you, what are you so afraid of?\nDarling, you\nYou give, but you cannot take love\n\nBeen Baka aka Not Nice from time, G\nBeen a East Side ting\nScarborough ting from time, G\nBeen have up di ting dem from time, G\nSo I don't know what's wrong with these\nLittle wasteman out here, eh?\nY'all need to know yourself",

I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through\nTrust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too\nAyy, dios m\u00edo, the ice is fr\u00edo on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God\nI'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the GOAT\nCould try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage\nNone of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade\nNone of this shit's a mirage\nThought I was seein' things when I was seein' green\n6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir",

Speak up!\nI mean, do you even know how to spell it?\nWell, I'll spell it for you, yeah\nIt goes \"L-O-V-E\"\nYou spell it \"L-O-V-E\", yeah\n\n\nAh, you've got to have love, you've got to have love\nYes, you've got to have love, you've got to have love\nYes, you've got to have love, you've got to have love\nYes, you've got to have love, you've got to have love, oh-woah",

I'm the Acid Queen\nI'm riding in a long, black Lincoln limousine\nRidin' in the back seat next to my wife\nHeaded straight on in to the afterlife\nI'm leaning to the left, I got my head in her lap\nOh Lord, I've been led into some kind of a trap\nWhere we ask no quarter, and no quarter do we give\nWe're right down the street, from the street where you live\nThey mutilated his body and they took out his brain\nWhat more could they do? They piled on the pain\nBut his soul was not there where it was supposed to be at\nFor the last fifty years they've been searchin' for that\nFreedom, oh freedom, freedom over me\nI hate to tell you, mister, but only dead men are free\nSend me some lovin', then tell me no lie\nThrow the gun in the gutter and walk on by\nWake up, little Susie, let's go for a drive\nCross the Trinity River, let's keep hope alive\nTurn the radio on, don't touch the dials\nParkland Hospital, only six more miles\nYou got me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, you filled me with lead\nThat magic bullet of yours has gone to my head\nI'm just a patsy like Patsy Cline\nNever shot anyone from in front or behind\nI've blood in my eye, got blood in my ear\nI'm never gonna make it to the new frontier\nZapruder's film, I've seen that before\nSeen it thirty-three times, maybe more\nIt's vile and deceitful, it's cruel and it's mean\nUgliest thing that you ever have seen\nThey killed him once and they killed him twice\nKilled him like a human sacrifice\nThe day that they killed him, someone said to me, \"Son\nThe age of the Antichrist has just only begun\"\nAir Force One comin' in through the gate\nJohnson sworn in at 2:38\nLet me know when you decide to throw in the towel\nIt is what it is, and it's murder most foul\n\nWhat's new, pussycat?

    "lyrics": "Found these old letters from years ago\nFelt it was fitting to continue that correspondence\nCan't help I'm sentimental\nThanks for talking with me today\nI hope this is helpful for you\nI also hope that Birdie is happy and healthy\nAnd staying out of trouble to a reasonable extent\nWhat I wrote was sort of my way of finally being able to address how it feels to have\u2026\n\nAnother brick-red room, another black-top town\nAnother misspelled band burning their own houses down\nAnother pine-box tune to fill the cemetery day\nAnother star, a touch of orange over purgatory gray\nAnother thorny field to scatter fruitless seed\nAnother song that runs too long, God knows no one needs\nMore misguided ghosts, more transparent hands\nTo drop a nickel in our basket and we'll do our RIOT! dance\nBeneath another burning sky, behind our painted lips\nIn scores of catatonic smile-covered ankle-bitten ships\nThrow your pedestal of stone in the forgetful sea\nAs protection from the paper-thin perfection you project on me\nAnd when this repetition ends, behind the window shades\nA semi-conscious sorrow sleeping in the bed I've made\nThat most unrestful bed, that most original of sins\nAnd you'll say that's what I get when I let ambition win\nAgain, I'd hate to let you down, so I'll let the waters rise\nAnd drown my dull reflection in the na\u00efve expectation in your eyes\nBack in a cast bit-part, back when I felt most free\nI had a butcher's heart and no one thought they knew me\nSo before the regiment resumes, before the dreaded sun appears\nMy driver's waiting, so let's make one point crystal clear\nYou see a flood-lit form, I see a shirt design\nI'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine\n\nYou're no friend of mine, you're no friend of mine\nI'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine\nYou see a flood-lit form, I see a shirt design\nI'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine\n\n\u2026To see myself in the reflection of people's eyes\nRealizing that what they see may not even be close to the image I see in myself\nAnd I think I might actually be more afraid to let my own self down than anything else\nI feel like the man in the story who saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat\nTwelve years ago, I stood on the shore and jumped in and grabbed the coat\nThe river was rushing toward a waterfall\nAnd my friend stood on the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land\nI let go of the coat, but the coat won't let go of me\nIn any case, please let me know if there's more I can give you\nIf nothing comes of it, then just know we are grateful",

Fuck being normal!\nAnd I just bought a new raygun from the future\nJust to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad\n'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad\nSingin' to a man while he played piano\nMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\nSo Ray J went straight to the radio station\nThe very next day, \"Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!\"\nLyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (\nJ.J. Fad\n)\nUh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human\nWhat I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman\nInnovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and\nI'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating\nHow to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating\nNever fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating\n'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated\nI make elevating music, you make elevator music\n\"Oh, he's too mainstream.\"\nWell, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\n\"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,\"\u2014'cause I found a hella way to fuse it\nWith rock, shock rap with Doc\nThrow on \"Lose Yourself\" and make 'em lose it\n\"I don't know how to make songs like that\nI don't know what words to use.\"\nLet me know when it occurs to you\nWhile I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you\nIt's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to\nProve that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!\nUgh, school flunky, pill junkie\nBut look at the accolades these skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to\nAnd I'm a million leagues above you\nIll when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you\nI'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel\nI'ma sleep in the front seat\nBumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still \"Chunky but Funky\"\nBut in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils and here's what they want from me\nThey're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred\nI have, then you may be a little patient\nAnd more sympathetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimination\nBut fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!\nBut if I can't batter the women\nHow the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?\nDon't mistake him for \nSatan\nIt's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation\nTo trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and\nDon't be a retard\u2014be a king? Think not\nWhy be a king when you can be a god?",

How's your daughter?\nMy girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father\nIf I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? I'ma name her Bonnie\nI read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry\nI had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him\nI know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan\nI even got the underground shit that you did with Skam\nI got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man\nI like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat\nAnyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back\nJust to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan\n\nMy tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I\nGot out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window (Window)\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could, it'd all be grey\nBut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)\n\nDear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance\nI ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans\nIf you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to\nBut you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew\nThat's my little brother, man, he's only six years old\nWe waited in the blisterin' cold for you, for four hours, and you just said, \"no\"\nThat's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol\nHe wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do\nI ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to\nRemember when we met in Denver? You said if I'd write you, you would write back\nSee, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither\nHe used to always cheat on my mom and beat her\nI can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs\nSo when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on\n'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed\nI even got a tattoo with your name across the chest\nSometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds\nIt's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me\nSee, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it\nMy girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7\nBut she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does\nShe don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up\nYou gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose\nSincerely yours, Stan, PS: We should be together too\n\nMy tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I\nGot out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window (Window)\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could, it'd all be grey\nBut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)\n\nDear Mr. I'm Too Good to Call or Write My Fans\nThis'll be the last package I ever send your ass\nIt's been six months, and still no word, I don't deserve it?\nI know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect\nSo this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it\nI'm in the car right now, I'm doin' ninety on the freeway\nHey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?\nYou know the song by Phil Collins, \"In the Air of the Night\"\nAbout that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'\nBut didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?\nThat's kinda how this is: You coulda rescued me from drownin'\nNow it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy\nAnd all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call\nI hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall\nI loved you, Slim, we coulda been together, think about it\nYou ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it\nAnd when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it\nI hope your conscience eats at you, and you can't breathe without me\nSee, Slim, shut up, bitch! I'm tryna talk\nHey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk\nBut I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see? I ain't like you\n'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too\nWell, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now\nOh, shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?\n\nMy tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I\nGot out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window (Window)\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could, it'd all be grey\nBut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)\n\nDear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy\nYou said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?\nLook, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that\nAnd here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on a Starter cap\nI'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you\nDon't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you\nBut what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?\nI say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?\nYou got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'\nTo help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some\nAnd what's this shit about us meant to be together?\nThat type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other\nI really think you and your girlfriend need each other\nOr maybe you just need to treat her better\nI hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time\nBefore you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine\nIf you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but, Stan\nWhy are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan\nI just don't want you to do some crazy shit\nI seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick\nSome dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge\nAnd had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid\nAnd in the car, they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to\nCome to think about it, his name was, it was you\nDamn",

bringin' the killer within me outta me\nYou don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me\nAnd be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be\nEvery bit of me's the epitome of a

you, bitch, I'm unfadable\nYou wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable\nI'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable\nI'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money

(Yeah)\nInvite 'em in like a One A Day\nI'm not done (Preach!)\n'Cause I feel like the beast of burden\nThat line in the sand, was it even worth it?\n'Cause the way I see people turning's\nMakin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose\nI'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds\nAnd I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word\nHas the court of public opinion reached a verdict\nOr still yet to be determined?\n'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped\nBut if I could go back, I'd at least reword it\nAnd say I empathize with the people this evil serpent\nSold the dream to that he's deserted\nBut I think it's workin'\nThese verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous\nAnd he's too scurred to answer me with words\n'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered\nBut I know at least he's heard it\n'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service\nTo meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him\nOr ask if I'm linked to terrorists\nI said, \"Only when it comes to ink and lyricists\"\nBut my beef is more media journalists\n(Hold up, hold up, hold up)\nI said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist\nCan get a mouthful of flesh\nAnd yes, I mean eating a penis\n'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death\nSo I've been givin' the media fingers\nDon't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh\nBut they've been puttin' me through the ringer\nSo I ain't ironin' shit out with the press\nBut I just took this beat to the cleaners",

    "lyrics": "Yeah, it's my life (\nHey, Hailie\n)\nIn my own words, I guess\n\nHave you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for?\nNot the expression, no, literally give an arm for\nWhen they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor\nAnd you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her\nBut what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?\nAnd everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?\nWhat happens when you become the main source of her pain?\n\"Daddy, look what I made!\" \"Dad's gotta go catch a plane\"\n\"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?\"\n\"I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy\nDaddy's writin' a song, the song ain't gon' write itself\nI'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself\"\nThen turn right around on that song and tell her you love her\nAnd put hands on her mother who's a spittin' image of her\nThat's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy\nShady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby, ha\n\nAnd when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'\nAnd I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back\nAnd when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'\nAnd I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back\n\nI keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing\nShe keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing\n\"You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?\"\n\"Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more\" \"Daddy, you're lyin'\nYou always say that, you always say, 'This is the last time'\nBut you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine\"\nShe's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it\n\"Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!\"\nGoes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket\nIt's got a picture, \"This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it wit' ya\"\nI look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror\nThese fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause, man, I can hear 'em\nThey're sayin', \"You got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight\nNow go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late\"\nAnd just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door\nIt turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on, and I'm singin'\n\nAnd when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'\nAnd I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back\nAnd when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'\nAnd I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back\n\nSixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat\nThe curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet\nI take a bow and \"Thank you all for comin' out\"\nThey're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd\nI glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'\n\"Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!\"\n\"But, baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?\"\n\"I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'\nYou lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad\nAnd I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'\nThat's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin\nI get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'\"\n\"But, baby, wait!\" \"It's too late, Dad, you made the choice\nNow go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us\nThat's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep\nScreamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep\nJust take another pill, yeah, I bet you, you will\nYou rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real\"\nI hear applause, all this time I couldn't see\nHow could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?\nI turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it\nPut it to my brain, scream, \"Die, Shady!\", and pop it\nThe sky darkens, my life flashes\nThe plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes\nThat's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'\nIt's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'\nI walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her\nHailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say\n\nAnd when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'\nAnd I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back\nAnd when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'\nAnd I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back\n\n*Curtains closing*",

lately, g-yeah\nCouple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can\nShots in the crowd, then everybody ran\nCrew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave\nShots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave\nMount up, regulators in the whip\nDown the boulevard with the pistol grip, g-yeah\nTrip, we in the hood still\nSo, loc, grab a strap 'cause, g-yeah, it's so real, g-yeah\nDeal with the outcome, a strap in the hand\nAnd a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand\n\nIf I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?\nPerceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street\nWith a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?\nIf I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?\nWould you say my intelligence now is great relief?\nAnd it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep\nWith dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor\nInstead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage\nKill 'em all if they gossip\nThe Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option\nOf livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins\nConstantly drinkin' and drive\nHit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye\nListen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide\nOut that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes\nProbably go to the projects\nI live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA\nMade me an Angel on Angel Dust, what?\n\n*Scratches*\nM.A.A.d city\nCompton\n\nNigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn\nYou ain't the one that got fucked up\nWhat you holdin' it for?\nNiggas always actin' unsensitive and shit\nNigga, that ain't no word\nNigga, shut up\nHey, Dot, you good, my nigga?\nDon't even trip\nJust lay back and drink that",

    "lyrics": "When the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nI woke up this mornin' and figured I'd call you\nIn case I'm not here tomorrow\nI'm hopin' that I can borrow\nA peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important\nMy mind is really distorted\nI find nothin' but trouble in my life\nI'm fortunate you believe in a dream\nThis orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine\nAnd last night was just another distraction\nOr a reaction of what we consider madness\nI know exactly what happened\nYou ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help\nHeld him like a newborn baby and made him feel\nLike everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up\nBut the type of bullet that stuck\nHad went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands\nMy plan's rather vindictive\nEverybody's a victim in my eyes\nWhen I ride it's a murderous rhythm\nAnd outside became pitch black\nA demon glued to my back, whispering \"Get 'em!\"\nI got 'em and I ain't give a fuck\nThat same mentality I told my brother not to duck\nIn actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors\nI wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover\nThe life that I knew as a youngin\nIn pajamas and dun-ta-duns\nWhen thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb\nNiggas like me never prosper\nPrognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted\nThis Piru shit been in me forever\nSo forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever\nAnd I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did\nJust promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big\nAnd if I die before your album drop, I hope\u2014 [\nGunshots\n]\n\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nYou wrote a song about my sister on your tape\nAnd called it \nSection.80\nThe message resembled \"Brenda's Got a Baby\"\nWhat's crazy was I was hearin' about it\nBut doubted your ignorance\nHow could you ever just put her on blast and shit?\nJudgin' her past and shit?\nWell, it's completely my future\nHer nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit\nAnd I'ma need that forty dollars\nEven if I gotta fuck, suck and swallow\nIn the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed\nBy a married man, and father of three\nMy titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys\nMatter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's\nHe got a cousin named David and I seen him last week\nThis is the life of another girl damaged by the system\nThese foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em\nSee, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em\nBack to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim\nOf a family gene that show women how to be woman\nOr better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'\nThen you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught\nThree niggas in one room, first time I was tossed\nAnd I'm exhausted, but fuck that \"Sorry for your loss\" shit\nMy sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain\nIf you can't fit the pumps I walk in?\nI'll wait\u2026 Your rebuttal a little too late\nAnd if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song\n'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own\nAnd matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?\nA doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight\nI'll probably live longer than you and never fade away\nI'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate\nAnd I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'\nI'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'\nYou lyin' to these motherfuckers\nTalkin' about you can help 'em with my story\nYou can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga\nDon't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, bullshit\nAnd when I die, make sure my pussy tight...\n\nWhen the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nSometimes I look in the mirror\nAnd ask myself am I really scared of passin' away?\nIf it's today, I hope I hear a\nCry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon\nWith the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus\nI wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'\nThe scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance\nWith the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed\nMay the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons\nI suffer a lot\nAnd every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch\nI tie my stomach in knots\nAnd I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death\nMy imagination is surely an aggravation of threats\nThat can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful\nAnd I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch\nMaybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death\nReally stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest\nAnd you're right, your brother was a brother to me\nAnd your sister's situation was the one that pulled me\nIn a direction to speak on somethin' that's realer than the TV screen\nBy any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between\nHer personal life, I was like \"It need to be told\"\nCursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul\nExactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'\nOr steady bein' distracted by money, drugs, and 4-5's\nI count lives, all on these songs\nLook at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong\nFightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong\nAnd hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone\nAm I worth it? Did I put enough work in?\n\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooh\n\n\n(On the phone)\n\"Ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?\"\n\"Nigga, the homie's brother\u2014nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!\"\n\"Hey, come to the store for a nigga, one time.\"\n\"We on the block right now, my nigga, like, we\u2014nigga, we right here, my nigga.\"\n\"Bring a nigga back a black!\"\n\"Nigga\u2014bruh\u2014nigga, they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga.

white, somethin' black, I ain't mean black (\nAnd pray to the God\n)\nI hate everything black (\nWe don't believe\n)\nBlack, I want all things black\nI don't need black, I want everything black\nI don't need black, our eyes ain't black\nI own black, I own everything black\n\nSix in the morn'\nFire in the street\nBurn, baby, burn (You, you, you, you, you)\nThat's all I wanna see (You, you, you, you, you)\nAnd sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain\nIt's such a shame, they may call me crazy\nThey may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'\nBut homie, you made me (You, you, you, you, you)\nBlack don't crack, my nigga\n\nI'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015\nOnce I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean\nBeen feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses\nYou never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it\nI'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon\nHeritage of a small village, pardon my residence\nCame from the bottom of mankind\nMy hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide\nYou hate me, don't you?\nYou hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture\nYou're fuckin' evil\nI want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey\nYou vandalize my perception but can't take style from me\nAnd this is more than confession\nI mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion\nI'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it\nYou sabotage my community, makin' a killin'\nYou made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga\n\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot\n\nI said they treat me like a slave cah me Black\nWoi, we feel a whole heap of pain cah we Black\nAnd man a say they put me inna chains cah we Black\nImagine now, big gold chains full of rocks\nHow you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back\nBut now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block\nAll them say we doomed from the start cah we Black\nRemember this, every race start from the Black, jus 'member dat\n\nI'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015\nOnce I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean\nI mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society\nThat's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me\nCurse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing\nThat I'ma be just another slave in my head\nInstitutionalized manipulation and lies\nReciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes\nYou hate me, don't you?\nI know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself\nJealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt\nWatchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out\nMuscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah\nBlack and successful, this Black man meant to be special\nKatzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?\nHow can I tell you I'm making a killin'?\nYou made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga\n\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot\n\nI said they treat me like a slave cah me Black\nWoi, we feel a whole heap of pain cah we Black\nAnd man a say they put me inna chains cah we Black\nImagine now, big gold chains full of rocks\nHow you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back\nBut now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block\nAll them say we doomed from the start cah we Black\nRemember this, every race start from the Black, go scream mother\n\nI'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015\nWhen I finish this, if you listen, then sure you will agree\nThis plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred\nIt's genocism, it's grimy, little justification\nI'm African-American, I'm African\nI'm Black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan\nI'm Black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French\nBut fuck you \u2014 no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets\nI know you hate me, don't you?\nYou hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you\nI can tell 'cause your ways deceitful\nKnow I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle\nThinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him\nIt's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war\nTwo tribal armies that wanna build and destroy\nRemind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door\nBeefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score\nSo don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers\nOr tell Georgia State \"Marcus Garvey got all the answers\"\nOr try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day\nOr eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays\nOr jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements\nOr watch BET 'cause urban support is important\nSo why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street\nWhen gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?\nHypocrite",

Somebody that's holdin' my checks\nJust to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?\nI read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered\nHow did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?\nThe type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'\nDrill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'\nI practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck\nAt twenty-seven years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged\nHow they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city\nWhat they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me\nWhat they see from me would trickle down generations in time\nWhat they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines\nI'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity\nI'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me\nI'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride\n'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God\nI'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone\nI'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more\nI'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness\nFear, whatever it is, both is distinctive\nFear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth\nAnd I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\nSearchin' for resolutions until somebody get back\nFear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth\nAnd I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\nWonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap\nDamn\n\nGod damn you, God damn me\nGod damn us, God damn we\nGod damn us all\n\nVerse 2 says, \"You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities\"\nSo until we come back to these commandments\nUntil you come back to these commandments\nWe gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse\nBecause He said He's gonna punish us\nThe so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians\nAre the true children of Israel\nWe are the Israelites, according to the Bible\nThe children of Israel\nHe's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience\nBecause we chose to follow other gods\nThat man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee\nSo, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you\nBecause He loves you, so that's why we get chastised\nThat's why we're in the position that we're in\nUntil we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments\nAnd do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us\nWe gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live\nHere, in today, in the United States of AmericaI love you, family, and I pray for you\nGod bless you\nShalom",

Um\nSmell my gooch, you could kiss my buns\nAnd I don't give a shit, bend my rectum\nSomebody said bands make her dance\nShe thinks you're getting cash, no, bitch, you're dumb\nThe only thing that you're gonna get is this dick\nWait, turn this up, bitch, this my jam (Where the drums at?)\nHere, take a goddamn picture\nAnd tell Spike Lee he's a goddamn nig\u200bger\nAnd while you're at it, pass the lotion\nAnd fapping and Xbox Live, that fun\nBefore I cum, I call your sister\nWhen she comes over, I take picture\nInstantly put it on Instagram\nAnd suplex her off a building if I get banned\n(I'm just fucking around)\n\nTamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!\nWhy y'all so salty?\nHot tamale is on\nA can of beans, bitch, I'm on\nYour boy is bad to the bone\n\nBring back the horns that was played in the beginning\nAnd tell Tony Parker that I found his vision\nAnd if he's tripping off my sneak dissing (Uh)\nThen he has to deal with me and my minions\nTryna get a Bimmer, E46\nHave you heard \"48\"? Motherfucker, I'm great (Yeah)\nGolf Wang prints always cover the sleeves\nFrom cuts for the Biebs, 'cause he's puffin' the trees, please\nFuck I look like? Got a new bike\nTire never pop like the puss on a butch dyke\nThink I give a fuck, I do, I go raw\nThen I bust in her jaw like (Fuck that disease, bitch!)\nMy urethra, hole that I pee from\nBigger than the obese neck on Aretha\nNow turn that snare down, I'm back like I'm Rosa Parks fare\nOn the same damn bus like, \"You're going to jail now\"\n\nTamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!\nWhy y'all so salty?\nHot tamale is on\nA can of beans, bitch, I'm on\nYour boy is bad to the bone\n\nHow much wood could a woodchuck chuck\nIf a woodchuck could ever give a fuck? Bitch, suck dick\nMotherfuck' you and your opinions\n(Can you kick it?) Yes, I can, sir, where the lump is\nSicker than the last bar bold-er, I'm a CO\nColorado, fuck Michael, bitch, I'm badder than my BO\nFind me and Lance tryna dance during chemo\nBefore they repossess our strong arm bands and tuxedos\n\nYeah, buddy, this is my jam, na, na, na, na, na, na, na!\nGolf Wang, Golf Wang, no, fuck you, na, na, na, na, na, na!\nWhy y'all so salty?\nHot tamale is on\nA can of beans, bitch, I'm on\nYour boy is bad to the bone\n\nHow many fags can a lightbulb screw?\nWell, if it has a dick, maybe two or six\nAnd tell the NRA I'm 'bout to lose my shit\nAnd shoot through Wayne LaPierre's hair with a crucifix\nHow many ladies in the house?\nHow many ladies in the house without a rich nigga, huh?\nA little Jergens in my palm for the jerkin'\nHope my mom don't catch me\nTryna set mood, little RedTube, fuck lotion\nI don't need lube, dry fist suits me (Yeah)\nUp and down, friction make a *fap fap* sound\nThe shit's kind of disgusting, fap time\nAnd before I flatline, Clancy chimes in my room and catch me\nThis shit's so damn embarrassing, like\u2014\n\nOh, shit, aw, fuck\nWhat the fuck?\nAw, I'm sorry\nIs that my shirt?\nYeah, I'm sorry, I just wanted some bangs\nClean that shit up, we're going to the office!\nFuck",

This food for death, go 'head and fucking eat\nMy father's dead, well, I don't know, we'll never fucking meet\nI cut my wrist and play piano 'cause I'm so depressed\nSomebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed\nThis meeting just begun, nigga, I'm Satan's son\n\nMy mother raised me, a single parent, so it's apparent\nThat I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers\nAre much important, I'm getting angrier while recording\nI'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves\nOdd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental\nSimple, but probably not, fuck 'em\n\nI'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck\nDrunk white girls: the only way I'll get my dick sucked\nSuspended from school, coolest nigga without effort\nEasy to spot, like black bitches with fake leopard\nSoak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on\n'Cause this album pack enough evil that you can't fit inside a Jansport\nGo to school with this\n\nI go from AP to JC inside a fucking week\nWaking up with random girls like \"Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?\"\nI stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet\nEvery time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit\nNo to drugs, I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honor classes\nBy those that were slow as molasses\nTake this shit to school\n\nRaquel treat me like my father, like a fucking stranger\nShe still don't know I made \"Sarah\" to strangle her\nNot put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler\nAll because she said no to homecoming, demons running\nInside my head, it's telling me evil thoughts\nI'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares are caught\nGo to sleep\n\nI wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky\n\"Fuck me,\" the monster said, somehow the monster's dead\nInside of me, but the thoughts he tell me are still evil\nWith this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble\nI'm on my grind feeble, my music is either\nA fucking sin or too illegal\nPlay this shit in church\n\nI graduated without honors or a fucking father\nHe died (I'm so sorry) No, bitch, don't even fucking bother\nI wanted a brother, my mother, I told her, but instead\nI got a sister, just like me, with her mister nada\nSo both of our imaginations are creations\nOf the fucking situations that's having our brains racing's\nLike Dayton\nWearing some fucking Heelys\n\nI know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me\nBut times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly\nI'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11\nSeven, what's religion, nigga? I am legend\nI roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition\nI created O.F. 'cause I feel we're more talented\nThan forty year old rappers talking 'bout Gucci\nWhen they have kids they haven't seen in years, impressing their peers\nWith the same problem, the only way to solve 'em\nIs to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver\nLife's a salad, I'ma toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it\nShit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious\n'Cause my mothers let me do what I want, she wasn't careless\nProtective, she is the bear, this shit is so bare\nMy diary isn't hid, my father didn't give a fuck\nSo it's something I inherit\nMy mom is all I have, so it's never meet the parents\nWhen Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share\nThis confused boy, I wanna hug, oy\nI'm bad for your kids to listen to, soy is not the choice\nI'm bad milk, drink it\n\nWoah, um\nIt seems you had a lot to say\nAnd, uh, who knows?

Well now there's the last look at the clock this eve, and the time's just winding its way round to eight minutes to one.
